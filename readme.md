# Vite.NET Micro Front Ends 

This is a simple example of how to use the Vite.NET for easily implementing a micro front end pattern.

## Getting Started

By compiling the solution you will also do the installation of the npm dependencies. So there's no need to run NPM commands.

This project contains two Vite powered SPAs that are unrelated from one another, but still share a common layout in order to mimic what you can do with a micro front end setup. 

The apps are hosted under two different routes:

- /ToDo
- /Calculator

To see the project in action all you need to do is run the project in Visual Studio and you're ready to go.
